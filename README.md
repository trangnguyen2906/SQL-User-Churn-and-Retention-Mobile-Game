## 📌 **Background & Overview**

### Objective:
### 📖 What is this project about? What Business Question will it solve?

This project analyzes user behavior using data from the **Flood-It freemium mobile game**, available via the **Firebase public dataset on Google BigQuery**.

The primary focus is to explore:
- 📉 Churn Rate: What percentage of users stop playing after 1, 3, 7, 14, or 30 days?

- 🔁 Retention Rate: How many users return after their install date?

- ⚠️ Drop-off Points: At what point in the user journey do most players abandon the game?

- 📊 MAU & DAU: What do monthly and daily active user trends tell us about engagement?

- 🧠 Possible Reasons Behind Churn: Do uninstall patterns, short session durations, or low level completions precede user drop-off?
  
🎯 The goal is to **identify critical user behaviors** that can guide strategies to **reduce churn** and **enhance retention** in mobile games.

### 👤 Who is this project for?  
💡**Data Analysts & Business Analysts**: looking to quantify and understand churn

💡**Game Designers & Developers**: aiming to improve retention through data

💡**Stakeholders & Executives**: making data-informed decisions on product direction



## 📂 **Dataset Description & Data Structure** 

### 📌 Data Source  
- **Source:** Google BigQuery – Public Firebase Analytics Dataset
  - **Table:** firebase-public-project.analytics_153293282.events_2018*

- **Size:** **5.7M rows** covering in-app event logs across **114 days** from 12/06 to 03/10 in 2018

- **Format:**
  - .sql (queried directly via BigQuery)
  - .csv (for visualization via GG Colab)

### 📊 Data Structure & Relationships  

#### 1️⃣ Tables Used:  
⚠️ The original dataset is not clean and complex. Thus, I create a dataset called game_dataset for simpler analysis, which contains:

**user_install:** install events

**session_start:** session activity

**remove_app:** uninstall behavior

These are **view tables** created to isolate and query relevant user lifecycle events efficiently.

## 2️⃣ SQL/ Python Analysis

### 🔍 Retention Analysis
> In mobile games, retention measures how well a game keeps players coming back over time. It reflects product stickiness, onboarding success, and long-term engagement. This section focuses on calculating retention-related metrics using SQL with visualizations.

#### 🟡 **Active Users (DAU & MAU):** How many unique users open the app daily (DAU) and monthly (MAU).
  
```
-- Daily Active Users --
  SELECT 
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM start_session_date) AS month,
    COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS MAU
  FROM `sqlfinal-447808.game_dataset.session_start`
  GROUP BY month
  ORDER BY month ASC
```

```
-- Monthly Active Users --
  SELECT 
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM start_session_date) AS month,
    COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS MAU
  FROM `sqlfinal-447808.game_dataset.session_start`
  GROUP BY month
  ORDER BY month ASC
```

</p>
<p align="center"><em>Figure 3: Monthly Active Users Output (MAU Table)</em></p>

#### 💡 Observation:
- 📈 **Engagement Spikes:** A clear **surge** in daily usage occurred between **late June and early July**, with DAU **peaking** above **750 users**, likely tied to promotions or new feature releases. Post-spike, the DAU **stabilizes between 350–500 users.**
- 📅 **Consistent Weekday Activity:** DAU remains relatively **steady** across **weekdays**, suggesting stable engagement from the user base even outside weekends.
- 📊 **Monthly Active Users (MAU):** Although MAU increased from 3,876 (June) to 5,244 (September), June with only ~2 weeks of data still had nearly as many users as July (4,131) and more than August (3,906), suggesting **weaker engagement or user quality in July and August.**

#### 🟡 **Daily & Monthly Install:** The number of new installs each day.
   
> 🎯Analyze acquisition trends and evaluate campaign effectiveness.

> 🎯Supports cohort-based retention analysis and seasonal comparisons.

```
-- daily_install --
SELECT 
  install_date,

</p>
<p align="center"><em>Figure 5: Monthly Install Totals</em></p>

#### 💡 Observation:
- 📊 **High MAU in July–August ≠ High Engagement:** Despite relatively high MAU in July (4,131) and August (3,906), the DAU trend shows declining daily activity after early July, stabilizing between 350–500 users. 
- ⚠️ This suggests that although many users installed the app, **few returned daily**, pointing to weaker stickiness or engagement in those months.

#### 🟡 Cohort-Based Retention Analysis
  
> 🎯 **Retention After 14 Days:** Track the percentage of June (or other months) users returning on each day after installation (D1 to D14).
This shows short-term engagement quality after onboarding.

#### 💡 Observation:
- 📉 **Sharp Drop After Day 1:** Retention drops steeply from **67.65% on Day 0** to 16.72% on Day 1, and falls **below 10% by Day 3**, indicating early user churn is a **key issue.**
- 📊 **Low Long-Term Retention:** From **Day 7 onward**, retention rates stay consistently **below 6.5%**, suggesting limited long-term engagement.
- 🔁 **Consistent Pattern Across Months:** Similar 14-day retention patterns were observed in other months, confirming this early drop-off is not unique to June but a recurring trend in user behavior.

<p align="center"><em>Figure 8: Monthly Retention Rate by Install Cohort</em></p>


#### 💡 Observation:
- 📉 **Sharp Drop After Month 0:** Most cohorts show a big drop from install month to Month 1. For example, June drops from **64.8% to 26.4%**, and August drops from **75.0% to 24.1%**, confirming early churn as a persistent issue.
- ⚠️ Retention data for **September and October** is **incomplete** due to the dataset ending on **October 3**, so long-term trends for these cohorts are not fully available.


### 🔍 **Churn Analysis**
> Churn is defined as **users who do not return after a certain number of days since installation.** This helps identify early **user drop-off** and guide retention strategy improvements.

## 🔎 Final Conclusion & Recommendations  

👉🏻 Based on the insights and findings above, I would recommend the **product team** to consider the following actions:

### ✨ Key Takeaways:

✔️ **Improve Early User Experience**: Over **86 percent of users** churn within the **first 3 days**, and uninstall most often occurs on **Day 0**. Focus on **optimizing onboarding, and first-level satisfaction.**

✔️ **Investigate Issues with Version 2.62**: This version alone accounted for over 1,600 uninstalls, a major spike compared to others. A thorough **QA review** and **user feedback loop** is essential for that release.

✔️ **Target Android Optimization**: All uninstalls occurred on Android, signaling a need for **platform-specific performance tuning**, **crash fixing**, or **UI refinement** for Android users.

✔️ **Boost Engagement After First Session**: The average churned user completed only 5.3 levels before uninstalling. Introduce **early incentives, daily streaks, or progress hooks** to extend gameplay longevity.

### 📌 Note on Limitations and Strategic Insight

While these findings provide useful behavioral signals, there are a few limitations to keep in mind:

⏳ The dataset only spans **114 days**, and I do not have access to **marketing campaign timelines** or **promotion schedules**. Therefore, the causes behind certain spikes (e.g. DAU or install surges) remain speculative.

❔ Additionally, **without data on ad frequency or user feedback**, whether **ad fatigue** contributed to user churn or not is remained unclear.

That said, based on observable patterns, it appears that **Flood-It! prioritizes acquiring new installs** **rather than nurturing long-term users**. However, industry research shows that **acquiring new users is more expensive and less sustainable than retaining long-term ones**. A shift in strategy toward **user retention and deeper engagement** could improve both lifetime value and cost efficiency.
