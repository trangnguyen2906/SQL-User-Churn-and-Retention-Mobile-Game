## 📌 **Background & Overview**

### Objective:
### 📖 What is this project about? What Business Question will it solve?

This project analyzes user behavior using data from the **Flood-It freemium mobile game**, available via the **Firebase public dataset on Google BigQuery**, using **SQL** and **Python (for visualization)** 

The primary focus is to explore:
- 📉 **Churn Rate:** What percentage of users stop playing after 1, 3, 7, 14, or 30 days?

- 🔁 **Retention Rate**: How many users return after their install date?

- ⚠️ **Drop-off Points**: At what point in the user journey do most players abandon the game?

- 📊 **MAU & DAU**: What do monthly and daily active user trends tell us about engagement?

- 🧠 **Possible Reasons Behind Churn**: Do uninstall patterns, short session durations, or low level completions precede user drop-off?
  
🎯 The goal is to **identify critical user behaviors** that can guide strategies to **reduce churn** and **enhance retention** in mobile games.

### 👤 Who is this project for?  
💡**Data Analysts & Business Analysts**: looking to quantify and understand churn

💡**Game Designers & Developers**: aiming to improve retention through data

💡**Stakeholders & Executives**: making data-informed decisions on product direction



## 📂 **Dataset Description & Data Structure** 

### 📌 Data Source  
- **Source:** Google BigQuery – Public Firebase Analytics Dataset
  - **Table:** firebase-public-project.analytics_153293282.events_2018*

- **Size:** **5.7M rows** covering in-app event logs across **114 days** from 12/06 to 03/10 in 2018

- **Format:**
  - .sql (queried directly via BigQuery)
  - .csv (for visualization via GG Colab)

### 📊 Data Structure & Relationships  

#### 1️⃣ Tables Used:  
⚠️ The original dataset is not clean and complex. Thus, I create a dataset called game_dataset for simpler analysis, which contains:

**user_install:** install events

**session_start:** session activity

**remove_app:** uninstall behavior

These are **view tables** created to isolate and query relevant user lifecycle events efficiently.  

#### 2️⃣ Table Schema & Data Snapshot

## ⚒️ Main Process

## 1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing 

I transformed raw Firebase event logs into simplified, queryable views to support retention and churn analysis. This involved cleaning, filtering, and restructuring the data into **3 main views:**


**🧩 `user_install` View** : Install-related user data.

<details>
<summary>📋 Steps</summary>

- Converted `user_first_touch_timestamp` into `install_date` and `install_time`  
- Cleaned the `source` field by removing special characters  
- Standardized `install_source` (e.g., mapped `com.android.vending` → `android`)  
- Parsed `version` into components to assess version recency  
- Used `ROW_NUMBER()` to retain only the most recent install per user  
- Removed records with missing install source  
</details>


**🧩 `remove_app` View** : Identify genuine uninstall events.

<details>
<summary>📋 Steps</summary>

- Filtered for `event_name = 'app_remove'`  
- Extracted `remove_date` and `remove_time` from event timestamp  
- Included uninstall-related fields: `platform` and `app_version`  
- Excluded users who had any activity after uninstall (via `LEFT JOIN`)  
- Kept only uninstall records that marked actual user exit  
</details>

**🧩 `session_start` View** : Track user activity sessions.

<details>
<summary>📋 Steps</summary>

- Filtered for `event_name = 'session_start'`  
- Extracted `start_session_date`, `start_session_time`, and `day_of_week`  
- Captured `platform` and `app version` at session time  
- Sorted sessions chronologically
</details>

## 2️⃣ SQL/ Python Analysis

### a. 🔍 Retention Analysis
> In mobile games, retention measures how well a game keeps players coming back over time. It reflects product stickiness, onboarding success, and long-term engagement. This section focuses on calculating retention-related metrics using SQL with visualizations.

#### 🟡 **Active Users (DAU & MAU):** How many unique users open the app daily (DAU) and monthly (MAU).
  
```sql 
-- Daily Active Users --
  SELECT 
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM start_session_date) AS month,
    COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS MAU
  FROM `sqlfinal-447808.game_dataset.session_start`
  GROUP BY month
  ORDER BY month ASC
```

```sql
-- Monthly Active Users --
  SELECT 
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM start_session_date) AS month,
    COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS MAU
  FROM `sqlfinal-447808.game_dataset.session_start`
  GROUP BY month
  ORDER BY month ASC
```

</p>
<p align="center"><em>Figure 3: Monthly Active Users Output (MAU Table)</em></p>

#### 💡 Observation:
- 📈 **Engagement Spikes:** A clear **surge** in daily usage occurred between **late June and early July**, with DAU **peaking** above **750 users**, likely tied to promotions or new feature releases. Post-spike, the DAU **stabilizes between 350–500 users.**
- 📅 **Consistent Weekday Activity:** DAU remains relatively **steady** across **weekdays**, suggesting stable engagement from the user base even outside weekends.
- 📊 **Monthly Active Users (MAU):** Although MAU increased from 3,876 (June) to 5,244 (September), June with only ~2 weeks of data still had nearly as many users as July (4,131) and more than August (3,906), suggesting **weaker engagement or user quality in July and August.**

#### 🟡 **Daily & Monthly Install:** The number of new installs each day.
   
> 🎯Analyze acquisition trends and evaluate campaign effectiveness.

> 🎯Supports cohort-based retention analysis and seasonal comparisons.

```sql
-- daily_install --
SELECT 
  install_date,
  COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS daily_install
FROM `sqlfinal-447808.game_dataset.user_install`
WHERE install_date BETWEEN '2018-06-12' AND '2018-10-03'
GROUP BY install_date
ORDER BY install_date ASC

-- monthly_install --
SELECT 
  EXTRACT(MONTH FROM install_date) AS month,
  COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS monthly_install
FROM `sqlfinal-447808.game_dataset.user_install`
WHERE install_date BETWEEN '2018-06-12' AND '2018-10-03'
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month ASC
```

</p>
<p align="center"><em>Figure 5: Monthly Install Totals</em></p>

#### 💡 Observation:
- 📊 **High MAU in July–August ≠ High Engagement:** Despite relatively high MAU in July (4,131) and August (3,906), the DAU trend shows declining daily activity after early July, stabilizing between 350–500 users. 
- ⚠️ This suggests that although many users installed the app, **few returned daily**, pointing to weaker stickiness or engagement in those months.

#### 🟡 Cohort-Based Retention Analysis
  
> 🎯 **Retention After 14 Days:** Track the percentage of June (or other months) users returning on each day after installation (D1 to D14).
This shows short-term engagement quality after onboarding.

```sql
WITH installs AS (
  SELECT
    user_id,
    install_date
  FROM `sqlfinal-447808.game_dataset.user_install`
  WHERE install_date BETWEEN '2018-06-12' AND '2018-06-30'

<p align="center"><em>Figure 7: Average Retention Rate per Day After Install (All Users)</em></p>


#### 💡 Observation:
- 📉 **Sharp Drop After Day 1:** Retention drops steeply from **67.65% on Day 0** to 16.72% on Day 1, and falls **below 10% by Day 3**, indicating early user churn is a **key issue.**
- 📊 **Low Long-Term Retention:** From **Day 7 onward**, retention rates stay consistently **below 6.5%**, suggesting limited long-term engagement.
- 🔁 **Consistent Pattern Across Months:** Similar 14-day retention patterns were observed in other months, confirming this early drop-off is not unique to June but a recurring trend in user behavior.

> 🎯 **Monthly Cohort Retention (Over 4 Months):** Measure long-term retention for monthly cohorts (e.g., June–October). This provides insight into user lifetime engagement trends.

```sql

</p>
<p align="center"><em>Figure 8: Monthly Retention Rate by Install Cohort</em></p>


#### 💡 Observation:
- 📉 **Sharp Drop After Month 0:** Most cohorts show a big drop from install month to Month 1. For example, June drops from **64.8% to 26.4%**, and August drops from **75.0% to 24.1%**, confirming early churn as a persistent issue.
- ⚠️ Retention data for **September and October** is **incomplete** due to the dataset ending on **October 3**, so long-term trends for these cohorts are not fully available.


### b. 🔍 **Churn Analysis**
> Churn is defined as **users who do not return after a certain number of days since installation.** This helps identify early **user drop-off** and guide retention strategy improvements.

#### 🟡 Churn Rates After 3, 7, 14, 30 Days
  
```sql

#### 💡 Observation:
- 📉 **Massive Early Churn:** **Over 86 percent of users churn** **within the first 3 days**, and by **Day 30**, churn exceeds **95 percent** in August, revealing severe early drop-off
- 🔁 **June Retained Slightly Better:** June had the lowest Day 30 churn at 91.3 percent, slightly better than July at 90.7 percent and August at 95.4 percent, suggesting stronger user engagement early on

#### 🟡 Possible Reason for churn/removove app

> ❓Which **app versions** and **platforms** have the highest uninstall counts?

```sql
SELECT
  app_version,
  platform,
  COUNT(*) AS num_remove
FROM `sqlfinal-447808.game_dataset.remove_app`
GROUP BY 1,2

</p>
<p align="center"><em>Figure: Number of App Removals by App Version & Platform </em></p>

#### 💡 Observation:
- ❌ **Version 2.62 accounts for the majority of uninstalls with 1,684 removals**, far exceeding all other versions. This may indicate serious usability or performance issues in that specific release.
- 📱 **All uninstalls occurred on Android**, suggesting that any churn mitigation efforts should focus on Android-specific debugging and optimization.


> ❓**How long** users wait after their **last session before uninstalling the app**? (Indicates whether churn is immediate or delayed and may reflect disengagement periods.)

```sql

from churn_total_complete

-- Output: 5.3 -- 
```

#### 💡 Observation:
🎮 Users who uninstall within a day complete an average of **5.3 levels** before leaving, indicating that early churn often occurs after only limited gameplay experience.

## 🔎 Final Conclusion & Recommendations  

👉🏻 Based on the insights and findings above, I would recommend the **product team** to consider the following actions:

### ✨ Key Takeaways:

#### 🔻 1. Reduce Churn

✔️ **Improve Onboarding & First-Day Experience**  

Over 86% of users churn within the first 3 days, and a large portion uninstall the app on **Day 0**.  

→ Focus on smoother onboarding flows, clearer game tutorials, and more engaging first-level design.

✔️ **Fix Version-Specific Issues (v2.62)**  

Version **2.62** alone caused over **1,600 uninstalls**, far more than any other version.  

→ Conduct a thorough **QA review**, debug performance issues, and gather **user feedback** for that release.

✔️ **Target Android-Specific Optimization**  
All app removals occurred on **Android devices**.  

→ Implement platform-specific **crash fixes**, improve **load speed**, and ensure **UI responsiveness** on Android.

#### 🔺 2. Enhance Retention

✔️ **Strengthen Engagement After First Session**  

Churned users completed only **5.3 levels** on average before leaving.  

→ Add **progressive rewards**, **early incentives**, or **daily streak mechanics** to encourage continued play.

✔️ **Monitor Session Behavior to Personalize Content**  

Retention drops consistently after **Day 1–3**.  

→ Consider triggering **in-game messages**, **hints**, or **milestone nudges** based on user inactivity patterns.

✔️ **Improve Long-Term Value with Monthly Cohort Analysis**  

Retention beyond **7 days** stays below **6.5%**, showing poor long-term stickiness.

→ Design **event-driven content** or **weekly challenges** that keep users active beyond the first week.

### 📌 Note on Limitations and Strategic Insight

While these findings provide useful behavioral signals, there are a few limitations to keep in mind:

⏳ The dataset only spans **114 days**, and I do not have access to **marketing campaign timelines** or **promotion schedules**. Therefore, the causes behind certain spikes (e.g. DAU or install surges) remain speculative.

❔ Additionally, **without data on ad frequency or user feedback**, whether **ad fatigue** contributed to user churn or not is remained unclear.

That said, based on observable patterns, it appears that **Flood-It! prioritizes acquiring new installs** **rather than nurturing long-term users**. However, industry research shows that **acquiring new users is more expensive and less sustainable than retaining long-term ones**. A shift in strategy toward **user retention and deeper engagement** could improve both lifetime value and cost efficiency.
